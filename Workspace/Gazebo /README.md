The minimum requirements to pass this assesment are: 
1. To build a single floor wall structure using the Building Editor tool in Gazebo. Using at least one feature, one color, and optionally one texture to the structure.There must be enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.
2. Model an object using the Model Editor tool in Gazebo. The model links should be connected with joints.
3. Import the structure and two instances of the model inside an empty Gazebo World.
4. Import at least one model from the Gazebo online library and implement it in the existing Gazebo world.
5. Write a C++ World Plugin to interact with the world. The code should display “Welcome to ’s World!” message as soon as you launch the Gazebo world file.

This is what my submission looks like:
